Hello! H0ndred here ;D

Here is the basic Liscence:

1. Give proper attribution/credit, even if modified: H0ndred and/or this link:
https://h0ndred.itch.io/

2. You can use this in both commercial and non-commercial games.

3. You can modify the assets.

4. You cannot resell or redistribute the assets, even if modified.

5. You cannot sell/redistribute these assets on merchandize. 
 For example: T-Shirts, cups or mugs, prints and other forms
 of tangible merch. You'll need to reach out to me to discuss
 merch of the art or get clarification if you need. 
 You can reach out to me through itch(H0ndred),
 on discord(H0ndredEx), or on instagram(H0ndredEx).
 **Hopefully no one needs to, I don't think these assets are anything
  special.**
